 This example uses two ultrasonic sensors. The left one is connected to DP4 and
 the right one to A1 on the Svante robot. When the distance to an object for each
 sensor is calculated we can see if the object is in front, to the left or to the 
 right of the robot. This information is printed to the serial monitor.
 
 This is an example from the Svante robot summer camp.
