/*
*  Industry Robot
*  Make a robot that helps manufacturing in factories!
*  The robot follows a black line, across a few work stations.
*  Whenever it reaches a workstation(end line), it performs a 
*  Serials of logo movements to deliver raw materials into the
*  machine. 
*  You need to fine tune the logo movement so it both pushes 
*  the object to the right position, and returns to the track
*  afterwards. You can also fine tune the line follower 
*  parameters so it runs faster along the track.
*  
*  This is an example from the Svante robot summer camp.
